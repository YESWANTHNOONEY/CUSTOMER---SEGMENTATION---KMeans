# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Overview  
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, providing insights for data-driven decision-making.  

ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of **50 customers** with the following attributes:  
- Age  
- Annual Income (USD)  
- Spending Score (1-100)  

ðŸ“Š Insights & Analysis  
- Segmented customers into **four groups** based on spending behavior.  
- **Annual Income** plays a key role in customer segmentation.  
- **Spending Score does not strongly correlate with Income**, indicating diverse spending patterns.  

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Jupyter Notebook   
- **Excel Dataset**  

## ðŸ“œ Project Files  
- `dataset/` â†’ Contains the customer dataset (`Customer_Segmentation.xlsx`).
